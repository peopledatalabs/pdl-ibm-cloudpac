### External Data Sets
Transactional data is central to your business. But if you only analyze your internal transactional data, your analysis is incomplete. Complement your data with external data sets that give you a 360-degree view of your business landscape. The data in the external data sets can help you complete a more comprehensive analysis that can help you make better decisions.

IBMÂ® Cloud Pak for Data has partnered with industry leaders to provide easy and seamless access to external reference data that you can use to enrich your transactional data. Some of the data sets provide historical data, while others provide real-time data.

The data sets make it easy for data scientists to access the data that they need from the same platform where they run build and run their analytic models.

The following guides outline how to ingest PeopleDataLabs API and Flatfile product offerings into the [IBM Cloud Pak for Data](https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-data/resources):
